      <hr width="50%"></hr>
      <p>A neighborhood plan contact team (NPCT) is a group of individuals designated to be the stewards or advocates of their adopted neighborhood plan. They work with city staff towards the implementation of the plan recommendations, review and initiate plan amendments, serve as community points of contact, and work on behalf of other neighborhood stakeholders.</p>
      <p>The <b>North Loop</b> Neighborhood Plan Contact Team (NLPCT) is the NPCT for the North Loop Neighborhood Planning Area. The NLPCT is therefore responsible for working on the implementation of the <a href="ftp://ftp.ci.austin.tx.us/npzd/Austingo/nloop-np.pdf">North Loop Neighborhood Plan</a>.</p>

      <hr width="50%"></hr>
      <p>Despite its name, the North Loop Neighborhood Planning Area is bigger than the North Loop neighborhood! It includes the Ridgetop neighborhood (east of Airport to IH-35) and the so-called "Red River Sliver" (running east of Red River Street all the way down to 45th). Membership in the NLPCT is open to anyone living within its boundaries. A map of the North Loop Neighborhood Planning Area is below - </p>

      <hr width="50%"></hr>
      <p>The NLPCT is designed to be a venue for all neighborhood stakeholders to provide input and guidance on the development of our Planning Area. Neighborhood stakeholders are not limited to residential property owners. Ideally, the NLPCT will be comprised of property owners, business owners, and renters in the neighborhood. Please consider joining to make sure your voice is heard in the planning process.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">I'M IN. WHEN DO WE MEET?</h2>
      <hr width="50%"></hr>
      <p>The NLPCT strives to meet on the regular meeting dates set by our Bylaws: The second Wednesday of the months of February, May, August, and November at 7:00. Special meetings may also be called from time to time, and all efforts will be made to publicize these meetings to the widest extent possible.</p>
      <p>The most recent version of our Bylaws (below) also provides that NLPCT members should be allowed to participate in meetings remotely via teleconference, video conference, or on-line meeting technology. Starting in 2019, we will therefore be circulating online meeting bridges so that you can participate in meetings electronically. We sincerely hope that this will allow a broader, more diverse group of neighborhood stakeholders to participate in our meetings.</p>

      <hr width="50%"></hr>
      <p>First, you should take a look at our Bylaws below.</p>
      <p>If you still have questions, you can direct them through the NLNA's <a href="https://northloopatx.org/contact">Contact</a> page. The NLNA is a distinct and seperate entity from the NLPCT, but its leadership has a long history of participation in the NLPCT and can likely answer your questions.</p>
