      <p>Central Texas has always been vulnerable to certain natural disasters. However, climate change has the
        potential to increase the frequency and impacts of threats from extreme weather. The city of Austin has
        identified the following as the top natural disasters Austinites face:</p>
      <ul><strong>Flooding</strong>–Austin is prone to flash flooding during heavy rains, especially along its urban streams, including
        near Waller Creek in the North Loop neighborhood.</ul>
      <ul><strong>Wildfire</strong>–The combination of Austin’s abundant natural vegetation, high temperatures, and frequent drought
        exposes Austin to risks of wildfires. </ul>
      <ul><strong>Severe Weather</strong>–Austin is experiencing an increase in extreme weather patterns, from the persistent lows of
        2021’s Winter Storm Uri to increased summer highs exceeding 100 degrees. On March 21, 2022, six tornadoes
        occurred in Central Texas.</ul>
      <ul><strong>Pandemics</strong>–Enough said.</ul>

    <h3 class="pb-3">How the City of Austin Prepares for and Responds to Disasters</h3>
    <p>The City of Austin coordinates with multiple organizations, government and private, in planning for and
      responding to natural disasters. An organization responsible for coordinating emergency responses in Austin is the
      city’s <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/homeland-security-and-emergency-management">Office of
        Homeland and Security Management</a>. Not surprisingly, the city relies heavily on its routine operational
      functions, such as <a href="https://austinenergy.com/ae/">Austin Energy</a>, <a
        href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/watershed-protection">Watershed Protection</a>, and the <a
        href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/fire">Fire Department</a> to respond to natural threats. Due to the
      importance of climate change in increasing risks for the city, the <a
        href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/sustainability">Office of Sustainability</a> plays an increasing
      role in preparing for weather-related challenges.</p>

    <h3 class="pb-3">Household Disaster Preparedness</h3>
    <h5>Make a Plan</h5>
    <p>Planning involves developing an understanding of the significant risks that natural disasters could pose to your
      housing, your household members, and your pets. Is your housing in or near the floodplain or poorly-insulated, for
      example? Do you have children or household members with special medical needs or limitations? In what
      circumstances should you shelter-in-place and in what type of events should you plan to evacuate? What can you do
      to make your home more resilient to natural disaster threats? (The table below contains links to additional
      information on resources on emergency preparedness.)</p>
    <h5>Build a Kit</h5>
    <p>Once you have completed some planning, you should consider building two “kits.” The first kit is to ensure that
      your household has enough supplies on hand to shelter in place for several days. The second “kit” is to ensure
      your household has items it would need if you had to evacuate to another location for safety. </p>
    <h5>Know your Neighbors</h5>
    <p>Natural disasters can potentially affect the entire region, impacting the ability of the City of Austin to
      respond timely to some requests for assistance. Knowing your neighbors and identifying those who might need extra
      help during a disaster is critical to increasing Austin’s disaster preparedness. If you can help one of your
      neighbors, that could be one less emergency call that needs to be made.</p>
    <h5>Stay Informed</h5>
    <p>Download the Ready Central Texas app on your mobile phone and/or sign up for emergency notifications to your
      telephone, email, or text messages.</p>
