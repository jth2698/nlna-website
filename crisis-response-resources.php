    <p>In addition to natural disasters, neighborhood residents may occasionally experience challenges across a wide
      range of situations, such as meeting basic human needs, mental health, housing, etc. The City of Austin has
      various departments that provide client-based services, as appropriate, to provide assistance in these types of
      situations. A number of community-based organizations and non-profit organizations also work in this area. While
      the NLNA does not provide such services itself, we do want our residents to be able to locate these services, as
      necessary. If you have suggestions for resources to add to this page, please drop us a comment on our <a
        href="https://northloopatx.org/contact"> contact page</a>.</p>
