                        in flight. This is because fall migration includes both adult birds and juveniles that were born

            <p>Birds are already nesting in our yards. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service states that: “Most bird nests
                are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). This law says: ‘No person may take (kill),
                possess, import, export, transport, sell, purchase, barter, or offer for sale, any migratory bird, or
                the parts, nests, or eggs of such bird except as may be permitted under the terms of a valid permit…’
                Under the MBTA it is illegal to destroy a nest that has eggs or chicks in it or if there are young birds
                that are still dependent on the nest for survival.” <a

            </p>
            <p>There are also baby mammals in our yards right now. Austin Wildlife Rescue (AWR) shares that well-meaning
                people can inadvertently “rescue” a mammal or bird that does not actually need to be rescued (and can be
                better cared for by its parents). They have an excellent flow chart explaining what to do if you find a
                baby bird or baby mammal: <a

            </p>
            <p>One mammal deserves special mention, and that is North America’s only marsupial, the opossum. During our
                Neighborhood Association meeting last month, we learned from AWR that opossums control our local tick
                populations. They also eat rats and cockroaches. They are transient, unsung backyard heroes, and they
                are sometimes struck by cars. Recently killed mother opossums may still have live young in their
                pouches. If you see an opossum on the road, the Opossum Society of the United States suggests that: “If
                safe to do so, pull over and move the body to the side of the road. If alive then seek immediate
                assistance. If it is a deceased female then check the pouch for any live young. If found then wrap in a
                soft, ravel-free towel and transport to a wildlife rehabilitator immediately. Young opossums cannot
                survive long outside the pouch environment.” <a

            <p>Finally, now is the time to properly mulch trees (using natural materials in a wide, flat circle and
                never “volcano mulching”) to prepare them before our summer heat. Earth Day can be observed all month,
                and “TreeFolks has named Earth Month ‘Mulch Month’ because that is the very best thing you can do for

                at night. Spring migration is already underway and we want to make their journey as safe as possible.
                Artificial lighting can cause birds to be disoriented and collide with buildings, and these avoidable
                collisions kill up to one billion migratory birds annually in the United States. The good news is that
                everyone can help. <b>Let’s turn off all nonessential indoor and outdoor lighting from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
                    March 1–June 15, but especially during peak migration dates of April 22–May 12.</b> Please shut off
                porch and garage lights, close your curtains and shades, and ask your office building management to shut
                off their lights at night, too. You’ll be protecting birds while also saving money on energy. Learn more

            <p>Native grass seeds can be planted in the spring, so this is a great time to start a pocket meadow. Native
                American Seed in Junction, Texas, sells native seeds and seed mixes designed to be an “ecosystem in a
                bag.” <a
                    href='https://native-american-seed6.mybigcommerce.com/'>https://native-american-seed6.mybigcommerce.com/</a>
                For example, non-native turf can be replaced with their “Thunder Turf.” There is even a “Pocket Prairie
                Mix” specifically designed to increase biodiversity in urban landscapes. Those who do not have a yard
                can still help restore lost habitat by following Homegrown National Park’s “Container Gardening With
                Keystone Plants” guide: <a

                <p>Urban wildlife habitats are also hurting after the recent ice storm, but a lot can be salvaged
                    through
                    proper care. Please see Texas A&M Forest Service's "After the Storm" resource under the Homeowners

                <p>February is a good time to support wildlife that will be migrating or having young soon. Because
                    cavity-nesting native birds are losing nesting sites to development and tree removal, providing a
                    nesting box in your yard can really help local wildlife. The National Wildlife Federation recommends
                    placing nesting boxes out by the end of the month in our area, and they have helpful guidance about
                    selection, placement and care: <a

                    Purple Martins, who provide valuable mosquito control, are already on the move. They rely entirely
                    on
                    humans for their nesting cavities, but becoming a “landlord” for these graceful birds requires
                    attention
                    to their specific requirements: <a

                <p>These are desperate times for the migratory Monarch Butterfly. Your kindness in providing milkweed
                    plants
                    for returning butterflies to lay their eggs here starting next month makes a real difference in the
                    survival of this species. The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation cautions home gardeners,
                    however, that “nurseries—even those producing pollinator plants—may have treated their plants with
                    pesticide,” so they offer a “Buying Bee-Safe Plants” guide:

                    Although milkweed seeds are best planted in the
                    fall like other wildflowers, Monarch Watch’s “Milkweed Market” for native milkweed plugs opens this
                    month: <a href="https://shop.milkweedmarket.org/">https://shop.milkweedmarket.org/</a></p>

                    <p><i>Climate change can be daunting. Even if individuals cannot personally solve the crisis, they
                            can
                            choose not to contribute to the problem by a “do no harm” approach in whatever balcony,
                            patio or
                            yard they can control. The quote often attributed to Mahatma Gandhi, “Be the change you wish
                            to
                            see in the world,” is relevant even here in our North Loop Neighborhood.</i></p>
                    <p><i>This column focuses on concrete, timely and frugal measures to support the struggling

                            and wildlife that are also a part of our urban density. Many of these creatures are
                            suffering
                            from habitat loss, pesticide, pollution and extreme weather. Compassionate urban land
                            stewardship matters to our native flora and fauna.</i></p>
                    <p>January is a good time to take care of work that might otherwise interfere with wildlife or risk
                        tree
                        health in the spring/summer. For example, is there necessary certified arborist work that might
                        be
                        accomplished now (before birds build their nests starting as early as next month)? January is
                        regarded as the last safe month to prune oak trees (always painting pruning cuts) <a
                            href="https://www.austintexas.gov/page/oak-wilt">before the risk of Oak Wilt increases</a>.
                        If
                        trees suffered severe damage during last summer’s drought, <a

                        <p>Spending time in nature is such a good thing for mental health. Taking a hike through the
                            woods
                            can

                            system
                            and also help you concentrate better. Getting outside and away from technology helps us to
                            connect back
                            to our roots, get grounded, and take a breath of fresh air. Spending time in nature helps us
                            to

                        <p>Ecotherapy is a type of therapy that involves spending time in nature with a trained
                            therapist to
                            process what’s on your mind while at the same time getting all of the mental health benefits

                                Award
                                in 2001.

                            <p>Martha took other key leadership roles around affordability and transit in Central
                                Austin.
                                Martha’s
                                neighbor
                                Judy Farley notes that “Long before Austin’s affordability became a common complaint,
                                Martha
                                championed working
                                with Travis County to build Travis Flats,” an affordable-housing complex at 53 ½ and

                                Martha also
                                served as the Ridgetop representative to the North Central I-35 Neighborhood Coalition
                                (NCINC), a
                                group

                                through Austin./p>
                                <p>Aside from her ongoing civic engagement, Martha cultivated relationships and
                                    practiced
                                    neighborliness
                                    in more
                                    informal ways. At Martha’s invitation, former North Loop resident Don Smith would
                                    join
                                    Martha in a
                                    monthly
                                    “reading aloud” ritual at her house, a practice they kept up for nearly two decades.

                                    Martha’s
                                    penchant for
                                    connecting people: “I have friends to this day I wouldn’t have met but for her
                                    introductions.”
                                    Sharing of
                                    people extended to the sharing of plants. Neighbor Donna Boyter still tends to a pot
                                    of
                                    Cast Iron
                                    plant from
                                    Martha in a part of Boyter’s garden that she plans to rename “Martha’s garden”
                                    because
                                    they would
                                    regularly
                                    sit out there together “during the COVID times.”</p>
                                <p>A remembrance of Martha would not be complete without a nod to her Texas-sized
                                    personality. Friends
                                    and
                                    neighbors described her as “a force of nature,” “a bit of a maverick,” “bigger than
                                    life,” and
                                    “outrageous in
                                    the best sense of the word.” Martha’s Austin roots ran deep, and she would often
                                    regale
                                    neighbors
                                    with
                                    colorful stories of Austin’s history. As former neighbor Bill Yoder puts it, “I
                                    can’t
                                    recall a time
                                    when
                                    Martha wasn’t smiling and laughing and telling jokes, and simultaneously castigating
                                    the
                                    incompetence and
                                    selfishness of Texas politicians.”</p>
                                <p>In her eulogy, Martha’s daughter Mary Alice Kuykendall observed that one of the many
                                    lessons she
                                    learned from
                                    her mom was “the strength and power that comes from community.” Neighbor Patrick
                                    Goetz
                                    agrees:
                                    “People like
                                    Martha are the glue that create community and hold society together.”</p>

                                        was; always
                                        ebullient,
                                        positive, diplomatic, and inclusive. I suspect it was literally impossible for
                                        anyone to not
                                        like Martha.

                                    effects that
                                    lifting the ban would have on public safety in Austin, and that this revealed a
                                    crisis
                                    of
                                    leadership. (As
                                    reported in Austin media, the 2019 camping ban modifications were discussed and
                                    debated
                                    in a
                                    series of public
                                    meetings, including opposition from incumbent District 9 council member Kathie Tovo,
                                    who
                                    requested delays to
                                    allow for further deliberations on some measures.) </p>
                                <p>The camping ban was reinstated in May 2021 in response to a successful ballot
                                    initiative
                                    sponsored by the
                                    Save
                                    Austin Now PAC, who recently endorsed Smith for the District 9 council position.
                                    Smith
                                    said the
                                    city must work
                                    carefully with nonprofit community organizations to make housing or shelter
                                    available to
                                    all who
                                    want it.
                                    However, he added that once housing becomes available, then he favors giving people
                                    experiencing
                                    homelessness
                                    the option of (1) accepting housing assistance and abiding by the rules, (2) leaving
                                    the
                                    city,
                                    or (3) being
                                    arrested. </p>
                                <p>On another public safety issue, Smith cited the worsening problem in fully staffing
                                    the
                                    police
                                    due to
                                    challenges in recruiting and retention. He said the city should be offering high pay
                                    to
                                    ensure
                                    that all
                                    positions, including those in and outside the police, are fully staffed. To improve
                                    the
                                    relationship between
                                    the
                                    city and the police workforce, he added, the city should apologize for attempting to
                                    defund or
                                    “reimagine the
                                    police,” which he believes should not have happened.</p>
                                <p>He supports steps to increase the housing supply, including streamlining the
                                    permitting
                                    process
                                    and
                                    increasing
                                    development on city transportation corridors, where the city should incentivize
                                    developers to
                                    build properties
                                    that are “higher, bigger, denser.” He also said he favors reducing the ability of
                                    environmental
                                    groups, like
                                    Save Our Springs, to obstruct pro-growth development.</p>
                                <p>Concerning TxDOT’s proposal to widen I-35 in central Austin, he said he is the only
                                    District 9
                                    candidate who
                                    supports cap and stitch. (Actually, candidate Linda Guerrero has also expressed
                                    support
                                    for cap
                                    and stitch.)
                                    He
                                    said he has talked to Adam Greenfield of Rethink35 multiple times, but he believes
                                    TxDOT
                                    will do
                                    whatever they
                                    are going to do. According to Smith, the cap and stitch effort may cost the city as
                                    much
                                    as $500
                                    million, but
                                    it
                                    will help eliminate the racial barrier created in 1928 that separates east from
                                    central
                                    Austin.
                                    When asked how
                                    the proposal would affect the barrier between North Loop and Windsor Park, he said
                                    he
                                    did not
                                    know because he
                                    was only familiar with the plans for downtown.</p>
                                <p>When addressing what distinguishes him from the other candidates, he said the other
                                    candidates
                                    were far more
                                    experienced and educated about government policy than he is. According to Smith,
                                    what
                                    distinguishes him is his
                                    unique professional experience and leadership skills, which included supervisory
                                    positions in
                                    golf course
                                    management and the insurance industry.</p>

                                        highlighted her experience negotiating with developers and building community

                                    <p>Guerrero acknowledged housing affordability and displacement as the greatest
                                        challenge facing
                                        Austin
                                        residents.
                                        As a recently retired AISD teacher, she elected to return to work for financial
                                        reasons in
                                        response to
                                        rising
                                        property valuations and taxes on her 1930s bungalow.</p>
                                    <p>Guerrero advocated for a number of ad hoc steps to expand the housing supply or
                                        improve
                                        affordability,
                                        including reviewing current codes and regulations for potential updates,
                                        rezoning
                                        properties
                                        from commercial
                                        to
                                        multiuse, reducing short-term rental units, and moving houses targeted for
                                        demolition to
                                        city-owned property
                                        or
                                        land trusts. She also supported incentives to obtain additional housing units
                                        for
                                        occupants
                                        at or below the

                                        percent Austin median family income threshold.</p>
                                    <p>In contrast to candidates from previous District 9 meetups, Guerrero did not
                                        voice
                                        support
                                        for
                                        comprehensive
                                        changes to Austin’s land use code--one of the most restrictive among large U.S.
                                        cities. This
                                        approach is
                                        similar
                                        to those taken by three council members who have endorsed Guerrero’s candidacy.

                                        said she considers
                                        herself to be a neighborhood preservationist, but that she is willing to work
                                        with
                                        others to
                                        find middle
                                        ground.
                                        As an example, she supported the University Neighborhood Overlay that increased
                                        density and
                                        affordability in
                                        West Campus and nearby areas.</p>
                                    <p>Concerning the TxDOT proposal to expand I-35 through central Austin, Guerrero
                                        said
                                        that she
                                        supported
                                        proposals
                                        to Cap and Stitch sections of I-35 between Cherrywood and Downtown in order to
                                        help
                                        heal the
                                        social
                                        divisions
                                        to
                                        which I-35 had contributed. When asked about actions to help reconnect St. Johns
                                        and
                                        Windsor
                                        Park with
                                        Ridgetop,
                                        she noted that these neighborhoods were not part of the current Cap and Stitch
                                        plan
                                        and that
                                        residents would
                                        have to make a lot of noise to get them added.</p>
                                    <p>On a final topic, Guerrero expressed support for a coordinated effort to clean up
                                        and
                                        improve
                                        Waller Creek
                                        above the UT campus, including the section in North Loop. Guerrero closed by
                                        pledging to
                                        have an open door
                                        for
                                        her constituents and to work with them cooperatively to find the best solutions.

                                        <p>On Saturday, September 24th, the Neighborhood Association welcomed City
                                            Council
                                            D9
                                            candidate <a href="https://www.zoforaustin.com/">Zohaib “Zo” Qadri</a> to
                                            North
                                            Loop as
                                            part of a series of candidate
                                            meet-and-greets.</p>
                                        <p>As with previous candidates, Qadri cited housing affordability as a key issue
                                            facing
                                            Austin. Qadri noted
                                            that
                                            despite their relative privilege as young professionals, he and his wife are
                                            unable to
                                            buy a house in
                                            Austin,
                                            which they would like to make their “forever home.” He also observed that
                                            affordability
                                            has many
                                            dimensions
                                            that
                                            need consideration when weighing solutions: it includes not only the cost of
                                            housing but
                                            also transit
                                            options,
                                            nearby groceries, and living wages.</p>
                                        <p>When asked about police issues, such as understaffing and slower response
                                            times,
                                            he said
                                            it was important
                                            to
                                            increase support for other first responders, such as EMS and firefighters,
                                            as
                                            well. The
                                            city could reduce
                                            police
                                            workload by diverting mental health incidents to EMS rather than the police.
                                            Qadri also
                                            wants to see
                                            equitable
                                            transit for communities of color, which would address public safety and
                                            climate
                                            change.
                                            Qadri called I-35
                                            “a
                                            scar that divides Austin.” His campaign is taking a “no higher, no wider”
                                            position on
                                            the proposed I-35
                                            expansion and supporting community alternatives like Reconnect Austin and
                                            Rethink35.</p>
                                        <p>Qadri cited his education, experience, and supporters as elements that
                                            distinguish him
                                            from other
                                            candidates
                                            in
                                            the field. Qadri has earned Masters degrees in both Public Administration
                                            and
                                            Global
                                            Affairs. He has
                                            worked
                                            in
                                            various city governments, big and small, and has done policy work at the
                                            Texas
                                            Capitol.
                                            He has further
                                            experience organizing both in the advocacy space and in elections. Qadri is
                                            running a
                                            pro-labor, unionized
                                            campaign and is proud of the support of labor groups, along with the number
                                            of
                                            grassroots and first-time
                                            donors
                                            contributing to his campaign.</p>
                                        <p>Throughout the conversation, Qadri expressed his love for this “big small
                                            city”
                                            where, as
                                            a South Asian
                                            Muslim,
                                            he has “always felt very protected.” He added that, while he is not running
                                            for
                                            this
                                            reason, it would be
                                            meaningful to be able to represent “a group often unheard” in Austin
                                            politics.

                                                priorities
                                                for the

                                                to
                                                other progressive candidates in the race, such as addressing
                                                affordability,
                                                transit,
                                                and equity.

                                                residents can afford to live here, Leffler said, is more important to
                                                preserving our
                                                neighborhoods than
                                                limiting
                                                what can be built here. As such, Austin’s current land use and building

                                                and building expensive homes, need to be changed, he said.</p>

                                                worked in a council member’s office and for the city’s audit office. He

                                                his experiences,
                                                including
                                                being raised in a “working class” family in central Austin, as a UT

                                            <p>Leffler said he is hopeful that November’s election will bring changes in
                                                the
                                                council
                                                that will build
                                                momentum
                                                for addressing the city’s challenges. We need city leaders who are
                                                willing
                                                to make
                                                the tough decisions
                                                necessary
                                                to address the issues we face, he said. Leffler has a Masters in Public

                                                <p>Spearman is an entrepreneur, community activist, and author. He
                                                    identified
                                                    affordability as the most
                                                    pressing
                                                    issue facing Austin, with the climate crisis as another growing
                                                    concern.
                                                    As an
                                                    example, he described
                                                    how
                                                    the
                                                    cost of living increasingly forces essential city workers, such as
                                                    EMS
                                                    technicians, to live outside

                                                    county.
                                                    As such, according to Spearman, the city loses the benefits of
                                                    having
                                                    these
                                                    workers embedded in our
                                                    communities
                                                    and also bears the increased environmental costs of extra traffic
                                                    and
                                                    urban

                                                <p>Spearman said he opposes TxDOT’s plans to expand I-35 through central
                                                    Austin. He
                                                    said there were
                                                    multiple
                                                    design-related objections to the project, but that he believes the
                                                    central
                                                    objections are related to
                                                    the
                                                    climate
                                                    crisis and racial justice.</p>
                                                <p>Spearman also shared his views on the city’s political culture. He
                                                    said
                                                    the city
                                                    has a mixed record
                                                    when
                                                    it
                                                    comes to following through with strategic plans. Too often, the city
                                                    delays
                                                    implementation of

                                                    Council hesitates due to a lack of consensus, according to Spearman.
                                                    He

                                                <p>Spearman declared it is imperative for the Council to focus on

                                                    solutions to the challenges

                                                    building diverse coalitions
                                                    across
                                                    neighborhoods, districts, and demographic groups based on shared
