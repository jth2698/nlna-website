      <hr width="50%"></hr>
      <p>In October 2021, the North Loop Neighborhood Association adopted a resolution to make addressing climate change part of its core mission. While the urgency and scale of climate change requires significant action on the state, national, and international levels, we believe that Austin’s diverse neighborhoods have a role to play, too.</p>
      <p>By coming together on climate, we can simultaneously address issues that we care deeply about as a neighborhood, from land use, zoning, and transportation to green space, housing affordability, and diversity. Above all, collective action will only strengthen our community–leading to greater resilience in weather emergencies, closer relationships with neighbors, and an overall boost in our health and well-being.</p>
