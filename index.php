    <p>The North Loop Neighborhood Association is a proactive, community based non-profit organization dedicated to
        improving quality of life for all those within our boundaries. The neighborhood is centered around North Loop
        Boulevard, and is bounded by 51st Street, Lamar Boulevard, Airport Boulevard, and Koenig Lane. There are
        approximately 1,400 households in the neighborhood. There is also a thriving local business and restaurant scene
        in the area on North Loop Boulevard, Airport Boulevard, and Lamar Boulevard.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">WHAT WE DO</h3>
    <hr width=50%>
    </hr>
    <p>The NLNA represents and serves all residents, land-owners, and businesses within the bounds of Koenig, 51st
        Street, Airport Blvd., and Lamar. The NLNA serves the needs of residents and business owners in this area in a
        variety of ways.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most importantly, <strong>we develop a sense of community</strong>. Through monthly meetings, group
            activities, and social gatherings, we give neighbors an opportunity to meet often and get to know each
            other.</li>
        <li>The NLNA stays active in <strong>defending and protecting our historical neighborhood</strong>. Our
            neighborhood is a precious jewel with a rich history.</li>
        <li>We can <strong>help with conflict resolution</strong> involving difficult neighbors. If you have concerns
            about noisy neighbors, loose pets or animals (other than the protected neighborhood guinea hens), trash and
            litter, or other issues with neighbors, bring them to the NLNA. We will work with you and authorities to
            resolve conflicts to everyone's benefit. We will be very discreet, and if you wish, we will protect your
            anonymity.</li>
        <li>We are in communication with the city about traffic and road developments in our neighborhood. If you have
            concerns about traffic or roads, we need to hear from you.</li>
        <li>We also <strong>represent the interests of our neighborhood with developers</strong> who are building new
            homes and apartments in our neighborhood, and ensure that development is consistent with the goals outlined
            in the <a href="ftp://ftp.ci.austin.tx.us/npzd/Austingo/nloop-np.pdf">North Loop Neighborhood Plan</a>,
            which was adopted by the Austin City Council on May 23, 2002. Members of the NLNA participated on the North
            Loop Neighborhood Planning Team (NLNPT) in the development of the official neighborhood plan. If you have
            questions about zoning or our vision for future development, we can put you in touch with the NLNPT.</li>
        <li>The NLNA <strong>maintains a public green space</strong>, Bruning Green. We encourage you to enjoy our green
            space located at the corners of Evans and Bruning. Other neighborhood green space projects may develop in
            the future.</li>
        <li>We have a history of success addressing problems and <strong>eliminating sources of serious crime</strong>
            in our neighborhood and support the Neighborhood Watch in our area. The weight and authority of a
            neighborhood association can accomplish so much more than lone individuals. We are in communication with
            other neighborhood associations and Austin city officials, and we are striving to better address the needs
            of our fellow neighbors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We hope you will consider joining us -- everyone is welcome to attend our monthly meetings on the first Monday of
        every month. To be a voting member who has a voice in making NLNA decisions, you need only pay dues of $5.00 per
        year.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to just drop in and attend a meeting -- even if you don't want to join NLNA, please come by and
        meet some of your neighbors. A calendar of meeting dates is available <a
            href="https://northloopatx.org/meetings">here</a>.</p>
    <p>We hope to see you soon.</p>
