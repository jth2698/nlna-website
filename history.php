      <p>What we now call North Loop (historically known as "Northfield") was not so long ago sparsely populated land north of Austin.  In the 1930s, a few suburban communities existed in this area.  Ridgetop was a community separate from Austin (with their own school), and Fiskville was the last stop on the railroad before Austin.</p>

Railroad tracks run down the left side of the picture, and Avenue F simply ends at the Airfield. The diagonal street that connected 53rd with North Loop was still visible, and none of Dr. Koenig's land along Waller Creek had been developed yet. (Although there does appear to be a small orchard and a large building where Chesterfield Avenue ends at what is now Nelray.)</small></p>

On that land in 1902, they decided to build an orphanage and school for African-American children.  The orphanage thrived as a cultural center for the African American community until the Great Depression.  For over 30 years after it closed, however, the limestone orphanage designed by notable architect John Andrewartha stood abandoned in the middle of a meadow next to the Tannehill Branch Creek.</small></p>

With no place to stay in town, they usually just slept in tents around the St. Johns Orphanage.</small></p>
          <p><small>It is also worth noting that neighbors claim that the Orphanage and community graveyard was located at the top of the hill where St. Johns Street and I-35 cross.  Supposedly graves were discovered when the highway and nearby businesses were built in the 1960s, but nothing was done about it.</small></p>

      <p>In the late 1940s, soldiers returning from war came to Austin to take advantage of the G.I. Bill that would help them go to colleges like The University of Texas.  This sudden population boom called for more development of housing, and the automobile made developments like Northfield possible.  Developers like J. S. Whitney advertised affordable lots in Murray Place and Northfield Addition that could be had for as little as $150.</p>

      <p>As our baby-boom generation came of age, Austin grew to the suburbs north of town.  People moved out of the city and enjoyed a lifestyle made possible by the automobile.  In the 1960s, the wide boulevard east of town known as East Avenue was torn up to make way for the new Interstate Highway 35.  A golf course owned by the Hancock family became a shopping center.  The strip-mall with the grocery store anchor became the standard form of commercial development, and the indoor shopping mall became the best way to escape the Texas heat.</p>

      <p>As the neighborhood filled-out, it attracted memorable restaurants and businesses. One such institution was "Scampi's Organ Palace." Scampi's was located at the southeast corner of Koenig and Lamar (the same lot currently occupied by the Goodwill / Half-Price Books strip center). For entertainment, Scampi's featured magicians, jugglers, comedians, flashing lights, balloons, bubbles, a cymbal monkey named Scampi. Scampi's centerpiece was a huge Mighty Morton theatre pipe organ, and patrons were treated to regular organ interludes as they enjoyed their pizza.</p>

      <p>The rest, as they say, is history.  Austin continued to grow, doubling in size every 15 years.  The suburbs of the 1950s became part of the urban core.  Suburban-style shopping like Highland Mall and Hancock Center thrived and then decayed.  The Drive-In theater became a relic of the past, and the Chief became an office-park.  The Chicken Shack became a vacuum cleaner store, and then a Taco Cabana.  The Mueller Airport became the Mueller neighborhood, and Northfield came out of the "flight-path" and became the trendiest, coolest place to live in all of Austin.</p>
